# No as a service (Go)

![](./NaaS.png "No as a Service")

This tiny API returns random, generic, creative, and sometimes hilarious rejection reasonsâ€”perfectly suited for any scenario.

## ðŸš€ Usage

**Base URL**

```
https://localhost:8080/api/no
```

**Method**: GET

### ðŸ”„ Example Request
```http
GET /api/no
```

### âœ… Example Response

Use it in apps, bots, landing pages, Slack integrations, rejection letters, or wherever you need a polite (or witty) no.
